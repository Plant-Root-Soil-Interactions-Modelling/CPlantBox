Topics that are not covered yet or should be improved

\begin{itemize}

\item Elongation rate according to Moacir et al.

\item Delay based, versus length based lateral emergance.

\item Better branching probability example.

\item Periodicity without DuMux coupling, but with a soil 3d grid (untested, and an example is missing)

\item Carbon limited root system growth

\item Direct vtk animation with vp.AnimateRoots (under development...)

\item The DuMux binding and MPI (probably belongs to dumux-rosi)


\end{itemize}
